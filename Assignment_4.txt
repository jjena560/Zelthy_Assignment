I have recently created an Ecommerce website named Proshop. I used Django in the backend to fetch data from my database and then I used React and Redux in the
frontend to fethc data from the server.
There is an admin panel
-Full featured shopping cart
-Product reviews and ratings
-Top products carousel
-Product pagination
-Product search feature
-User profile with orders
-Admin product management
-Admin user management
-Admin Order details page
-Mark orders as delivered option
-Checkout process (shipping, payment method, etc)
-PayPal / credit card integration


-React with Functional Components & Hooks
-React router
-React-Bootstrap UI library
How to structure components
-Component level state & props
-Managing global state with Redux (Actions & Reducers)
-Using Redux state in components (useDispatch & useSelector)
-Creating an extensive back end with Express
-JWT authentication (JSON web tokens)
-Custom error handler
-Integrating the PayPal API


I faced many challenges but the most hectic one was while I was Merging the two apps
